# Navigation and URLs

In order to move between pages in our app, we assign different URLs to different pages.
Here's a listing of the different pages and their urls:

* `/`: default home page
* Song pages:
  * `/justlisten`: Just Listen page for default song
  * `/listenlearn`: Listen and Learn page for default song
  * `/playalong`: Play Along page for default song
* `/<songpage>?song=<id>`: Song page for song with `id`

Mode selection should be part of the home page.
It should have a pop-up type functionality upon choosing a song.

Quizzes should be part of the Listen and Learn page.
They should also have a pop-up type functionality upon clicking "Take the Quiz".

# Language of Music

Georgia Tech School of Music

Project Studio Technology group project.

## Running the Project

This project contains a frontend run with NPM and a backend run with Python.
To start the project, you will need two terminals open.
Point both terminals to this directory.

Run the following commands in the first terminal:

1. `cd app`
2. `python3 -m flask run`

In the second terminal:

1. `cd app`
2. `npm start`

If this is your first time running the app, you may need to install dependencies with NPM and Pip.

## Git and GitHub Workflow

To add, remove, or change any code, do these things:

1. Checkout a branch (or make a new branch) related for the specific feature / change.
2. Make changes and commit them to the branch with a descriptive message.
   * Preferably, make your commits smaller rather than larger.
3. As you work, push the branch to `origin` so other people can see it.
   * Also, this serves as a backup of your work in case something happens to your computer.
4. When you are ready to incorporate the changes into the main code base, create a Pull Request on GitHub.
   * Give the PR a descriptive name and some additional comments explaining what it does.
   * Usually, you'll request to merge the branch into `master`.
   * Someone else in the group will need to review and approve your changes.
5. When the PR is accepted and merged, your changes are done!
